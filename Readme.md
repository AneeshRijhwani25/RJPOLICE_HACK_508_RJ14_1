# Police Feedback System
Greetings Everyone , we are Team RJ14. 
## Problem Statement

In addressing the challenges associated with obtaining feedback on police operations, there is a pressing need for a modernized and inclusive approach. Traditional methods such as inspections and complainant calls have proven to be outdated, restricted, and lacking in inclusivity. The current non-digital feedback mechanisms result in a lack of uniform guest records, inadequate staff for daily follow-up, and complications arising from a multi-lingual and digitally less-literate society.

## Solution

### 1. Bulk SMS Tool

- **Purpose:** Gather quick feedback on police interactions.
- **Implementation:** Choose a reliable SMS service provider (e.g., Twilio, Nexmo) and integrate their API into the system to trigger bulk SMS messages with a prompt for feedback.

### 2. Auto Chatbot

- **Purpose:** Engage users with structured questions and compile real-time answers.
- **Implementation:** Opt for a chatbot platform (e.g., Dialogflow), design questions, and integrate the chatbot into the backend for real-time response compilation.

### 3. Online Portal

- **Purpose:** Record detailed comments for a holistic view of community feedback.
- **Implementation:** Select a web framework (e.g., Django, Flask), create a user-friendly registration system, design a feedback form, and integrate the frontend with a secure database (e.g., MongoDB).

### 4. Social Media-Like Platform

- **Purpose:** Allow users to share experiences and categorize feedback based on specific locations.
- **Implementation:** Choose a development approach (e.g., Django), design an interactive frontend (e.g., React.js), integrate a database (e.g., MongoDB), implement geotagging with Mapbox or Google Maps API, and ensure privacy controls and OAuth 2.0 for user authentication.
